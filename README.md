# edi-cli

A modern, open-source EDI toolkit.

**edi-cli** is a developer-first toolkit for parsing, validating, and transforming Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) files. It provides a fast, well-tested core library and a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) to streamline working with complex EDI formats.

## Why Open Source EDI?

Despite a market dominated by commercial vendors, significant and compelling open-source opportunities exist for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). The inertia and legacy architecture of many established solutions have created gaps that a modern, developer-focused open-source project could effectively fill. The key lies in shifting the paradigm from monolithic, all-in-one platforms to more flexible, composable, and developer-centric tools that align with contemporary software development practices.

Here are some of the most promising open-source opportunities in the EDI space:

### 1. The Developer-Centric EDI Toolkit: "EDI-as-Code"
The most significant opportunity lies in creating a suite of tools that treat EDI as a development concern, not just a business process. This "EDI-as-Code" approach would resonate strongly with modern DevOps and software engineering teams.

**Core Components:** This toolkit would include a high-performance parsing and serialization library for various EDI standards (X12, EDIFACT), a powerful and intuitive mapping engine that uses a declarative syntax (like YAML or a domain-specific language), and a robust validation framework.

**Version Control and CI/CD:** A key innovation would be to enable the management of EDI maps and configurations within a Git repository. This would allow for versioning, collaborative development, and integration into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

**Command-Line Interface (CLI):** A powerful and scriptable CLI would be essential for developers to integrate EDI processes into their existing workflows and automation scripts.

### 2. A Modern, API-First EDI Translator
Many businesses are moving towards API-driven architectures. An open-source EDI solution that bridges the gap between legacy EDI and modern RESTful APIs would be incredibly valuable.

**Lightweight and Embeddable:** Instead of a large, standalone application, this would be a lightweight, embeddable engine that can be easily integrated into existing applications and microservices.

**Automatic API Generation:** A truly innovative feature would be the ability to automatically generate an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification from an EDI implementation guide, and vice-versa. This would dramatically simplify the process of exposing EDI data as a modern API.

**JSON-Native:** The tool would work natively with JSON, allowing for easy manipulation and integration of EDI data within modern applications before translating to and from the rigid EDI format.

### 3. A User-Friendly, Self-Hosted Web UI for EDI Management
While the backend can be developer-focused, a user-friendly front-end is still crucial for business users and support teams. An open-source project could provide a modern, intuitive web interface for managing the entire EDI lifecycle.

**Visual Mapping Tool:** A drag-and-drop interface for creating and managing EDI maps would lower the barrier to entry for non-developers.

**Intuitive Dashboard and Monitoring:** A dashboard providing real-time visibility into transaction status, errors, and partner activity would be a significant improvement over the often-clunky interfaces of older systems.

**Simplified Partner Management:** An easy-to-use interface for onboarding new trading partners and configuring their specific requirements would be a major selling point.

### 4. Cloud-Native and Serverless EDI
As businesses increasingly move to the cloud, there is a need for EDI solutions that can leverage the benefits of cloud-native architectures.

**Serverless-First Design:** An EDI translator designed to run efficiently on serverless platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions would offer incredible scalability and cost-effectiveness.

**Containerized Deployment:** Providing well-documented Docker and Kubernetes configurations would allow for easy deployment and scaling in any cloud environment.

**Integration with Cloud Services:** The tool could offer native integrations with cloud services like object storage (S3, Blob Storage) for archiving, queuing services (SQS, Azure Service Bus) for message processing, and cloud-based databases for logging and analytics.

### 5. Niche Industry-Specific Solutions
Instead of trying to be a one-size-fits-all solution, an open-source project could focus on the specific needs of a particular industry, such as healthcare (HIPAA), logistics, or retail. This would allow for a more tailored and feature-rich offering that could compete effectively with commercial vendors in that niche.

---

By focusing on these areas, an open-source EDI project could gain significant traction. The key to success would be to learn from the successes of other open-source projects: build a strong community, prioritize developer experience, and offer a more flexible and modern alternative to the entrenched incumbents. The opportunity is ripe for a project that empowers developers to solve their own EDI challenges with tools that feel familiar and powerful.

## Quickstart (5 minutes)

1.  **Install `edi-cli`:**

    ```bash
    pip install edi-cli
    ```

2.  **Convert an EDI file to JSON:**

    ```bash
    edi convert examples/datasets/sample-835.edi --to json --out output.json
    ```

3.  **Convert to CSV for analysis:**

    ```bash
    edi convert examples/datasets/sample-835.edi --to csv --out claims.csv
    ```

4.  **Validate with business rules:**

    ```bash
    edi validate examples/datasets/sample-835.edi --rule-set business
    ```

5.  **HIPAA compliance validation:**

    ```bash
    edi validate examples/datasets/sample-835.edi --rule-set hipaa --verbose
    ```

6.  **Inspect file structure:**

    ```bash
    edi inspect examples/datasets/sample-835.edi
    ```
