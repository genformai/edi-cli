# edi-cli

A modern, open-source EDI toolkit.

**edi-cli** is a developer-first toolkit for parsing, validating, and transforming Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) files. It provides a fast, well-tested core library and a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) to streamline working with complex EDI formats.

## Why Open Source EDI?

Despite a market dominated by commercial vendors, significant and compelling open-source opportunities exist for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). The inertia and legacy architecture of many established solutions have created gaps that a modern, developer-focused open-source project could effectively fill. The key lies in shifting the paradigm from monolithic, all-in-one platforms to more flexible, composable, and developer-centric tools that align with contemporary software development practices.

Here are some of the most promising open-source opportunities in the EDI space:

### 1. The Developer-Centric EDI Toolkit: "EDI-as-Code"
The most significant opportunity lies in creating a suite of tools that treat EDI as a development concern, not just a business process. This "EDI-as-Code" approach would resonate strongly with modern DevOps and software engineering teams.

**Core Components:** This toolkit would include a high-performance parsing and serialization library for various EDI standards (X12, EDIFACT), a powerful and intuitive mapping engine that uses a declarative syntax (like YAML or a domain-specific language), and a robust validation framework.

**Version Control and CI/CD:** A key innovation would be to enable the management of EDI maps and configurations within a Git repository. This would allow for versioning, collaborative development, and integration into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

**Command-Line Interface (CLI):** A powerful and scriptable CLI would be essential for developers to integrate EDI processes into their existing workflows and automation scripts.

### 2. A Modern, API-First EDI Translator
Many businesses are moving towards API-driven architectures. An open-source EDI solution that bridges the gap between legacy EDI and modern RESTful APIs would be incredibly valuable.

**Lightweight and Embeddable:** Instead of a large, standalone application, this would be a lightweight, embeddable engine that can be easily integrated into existing applications and microservices.

**Automatic API Generation:** A truly innovative feature would be the ability to automatically generate an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification from an EDI implementation guide, and vice-versa. This would dramatically simplify the process of exposing EDI data as a modern API.

**JSON-Native:** The tool would work natively with JSON, allowing for easy manipulation and integration of EDI data within modern applications before translating to and from the rigid EDI format.

### 3. A User-Friendly, Self-Hosted Web UI for EDI Management
While the backend can be developer-focused, a user-friendly front-end is still crucial for business users and support teams. An open-source project could provide a modern, intuitive web interface for managing the entire EDI lifecycle.

**Visual Mapping Tool:** A drag-and-drop interface for creating and managing EDI maps would lower the barrier to entry for non-developers.

**Intuitive Dashboard and Monitoring:** A dashboard providing real-time visibility into transaction status, errors, and partner activity would be a significant improvement over the often-clunky interfaces of older systems.

**Simplified Partner Management:** An easy-to-use interface for onboarding new trading partners and configuring their specific requirements would be a major selling point.

### 4. Cloud-Native and Serverless EDI
As businesses increasingly move to the cloud, there is a need for EDI solutions that can leverage the benefits of cloud-native architectures.

**Serverless-First Design:** An EDI translator designed to run efficiently on serverless platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions would offer incredible scalability and cost-effectiveness.

**Containerized Deployment:** Providing well-documented Docker and Kubernetes configurations would allow for easy deployment and scaling in any cloud environment.

**Integration with Cloud Services:** The tool could offer native integrations with cloud services like object storage (S3, Blob Storage) for archiving, queuing services (SQS, Azure Service Bus) for message processing, and cloud-based databases for logging and analytics.

### 5. Niche Industry-Specific Solutions
Instead of trying to be a one-size-fits-all solution, an open-source project could focus on the specific needs of a particular industry, such as healthcare (HIPAA), logistics, or retail. This would allow for a more tailored and feature-rich offering that could compete effectively with commercial vendors in that niche.

---

By focusing on these areas, an open-source EDI project could gain significant traction. The key to success would be to learn from the successes of other open-source projects: build a strong community, prioritize developer experience, and offer a more flexible and modern alternative to the entrenched incumbents. The opportunity is ripe for a project that empowers developers to solve their own EDI challenges with tools that feel familiar and powerful.

## What Works Now (v0.2.0)

### ‚úÖ **Core Library - Production Ready**

**EDI 835 Healthcare Claim Payment/Advice** - Fully implemented with comprehensive parser:

```python
from packages.core.transactions.t835.parser import Parser835

# Parse from segments or EDI content
parser = Parser835(segments)  # or Parser835()
result = parser.parse(edi_content)

# Access parsed data
t835 = result.interchanges[0].functional_groups[0].transactions[0].transaction_data
print(f"Payer: {t835.payer.name}")
print(f"Total Claims: {len(t835.claims)}")
print(f"Total Paid: ${t835.financial_information.total_paid}")
```

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Segment Support**: BPR, TRN, DTM, N1, NM1, PER, REF, CLP, CAS, SVC, SVD, PLB, LX + all envelope segments
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Parsing Logic**: REF*TJ as Tax ID (not NPI), CAS triplet support, composite SVC parsing (HC:99213:25)
- ‚úÖ **Financial Balancing**: Out-of-balance detection comparing BPR vs Claims+PLB totals
- ‚úÖ **Provider Level Adjustments (PLB)**: Full PLB segment parsing with reason codes and amounts
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Data Handling**: Dynamic delimiter detection, optional quantity handling, DTM qualifiers
- ‚úÖ **Robust Error Handling**: Integrated with StandardErrorHandler and contextual error reporting
- ‚úÖ **100% Test Coverage**: 72/72 tests passing with comprehensive edge case coverage

### üöß **CLI - Under Development**

The command-line interface exists but needs updates to work with the refactored parser:

```bash
# Will be available after CLI refactoring:
# pip install edi-cli
# edi convert sample-835.edi --to json
# edi validate sample-835.edi --rule-set business
```

## Quickstart (Library Usage)

1.  **Install the library:**

    ```bash
    pip install edi-cli  # Core library included
    ```

2.  **Parse an 835 file:**

    ```python
    from packages.core.transactions.t835.parser import Parser835
    
    # Read your EDI file
    with open('sample-835.edi', 'r') as f:
        edi_content = f.read()
    
    # Parse it
    parser = Parser835()
    result = parser.parse(edi_content)
    
    # Access the data
    t835 = result.interchanges[0].functional_groups[0].transactions[0].transaction_data
    
    # Print summary
    print(f"Payer: {t835.payer.name}")
    print(f"Payee: {t835.payee.name}")
    print(f"Total Paid: ${t835.financial_information.total_paid}")
    print(f"Claims: {len(t835.claims)}")
    
    # Access individual claims
    for claim in t835.claims:
        print(f"Claim {claim.claim_id}: ${claim.total_paid}")
        for service in claim.services:
            print(f"  Service {service.procedure_code}: ${service.paid_amount}")
    ```

3.  **Convert to JSON:**

    ```python
    import json
    json_data = t835.to_dict()
    print(json.dumps(json_data, indent=2))
    ```
